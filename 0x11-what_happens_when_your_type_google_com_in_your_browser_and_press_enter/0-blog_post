 Blog post explaining what happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter:
When you type https://www.google.com into your browser and hit Enter, a series of complex processes are set in motion behind the scenes to ensure that you are able to access the Google website seamlessly. Let's break down the key components involved in this process:
DNS Request: The first step is a Domain Name System (DNS) request. Your browser needs to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. It sends a request to a DNS server, which returns the IP address associated with the domain name.
TCP/IP: Once the browser has the IP address of the website, it establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures that the data packets are transmitted reliably between your computer and the Google servers.
Firewall: Before the connection is established, it may pass through a firewall. The firewall acts as a security barrier and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of rules. It helps protect your computer and network from unauthorized access and potential threats.
HTTPS/SSL: Google uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to encrypt the data transmitted between your browser and their servers. This encryption is facilitated by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, ensuring that your communication with Google is secure and private.
Load-Balancer: To efficiently distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, Google uses load balancers. Load balancers help optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload on any single server.
Web Server: Once the request reaches Google's servers, it is processed by a web server. The web server hosts the website's files and content, generates dynamic web pages, and sends the requested data back to your browser.
Application Server: In cases where the website requires dynamic content or server-side processing, an application server comes into play. The application server executes the necessary scripts or applications to generate the content requested by your browser.
Database: For websites that rely on storing and retrieving data, a database server is essential. The database server manages the storage, retrieval, and updating of data, ensuring that the website can access the required information efficiently.
In conclusion, when you type https://www.google.com in your browser, a complex interplay of DNS requests, TCP/IP connections, firewalls, HTTPS encryption, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases work together seamlessly to deliver the Google website to your screen. This intricate process happens within seconds, allowing you to access the vast resources of the internet with just a few keystrokes.
